                     The soft coral polyp that lived in the shell resembled a
                      modern sea anemone. Corals captured small animals and 
                      other food particles with a ring of tentacles surrounding
                       their mouth. Rugose corals included both solitary forms,

Many trilobites could roll-up into a ball for protection just like modern Isopods, commonly known as sowbugs or pillbugs. There are over 5,460 Ordovician trilobite species.
