                        There are major changes in biodiversity during the Ordovician Period. The first graph is called the Sepkoski Curve named after Jack Sepkoski, a University of Chicago paleontologists and professor who created the graph. 
                        He used thousands of data sets of fossil occurrences from around the world that represents the work of hundreds of paleontologists.  From the data he counted the number of marine families present in each time interval 
                        and plotted this curve.

                    <p>
                        The bottom axis represent geologic time dating back from 540 million years ago to the present (0 million years ago). The geologic time scale is also plotted along the X-axis the Paleozoic is colored blue 
                        and includes the Ordovician Period which is represented by an ‘O’. 
                        The y-axis represents the number of marine families living. It ranges from 0 at the bottom to 700 at the top. The higher the curve goes the more marine families that were present and the high the biodiversity was at that time.

                    The curve is shown in three colors, dark blue represents 
                    the Cambrian Fauna which is dominated by 
                    <span style="color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;">
                        trilobites and inarticulate brachiopods
                    </span>. 
                    The Paleozoic Fauna is a lighter 
                    blue and includes,
                    <span style="color: rgb(139, 139, 253); font-weight: bold;"> 
                        rugose and tabulate corals, bryozoans, 
                        articulate brachiopods, crinoids, and nautiloid cephalopods
                    </span>. 
                    The Modern Fauna in yellow includes 
                    <span style="color: rgb(209, 218, 34); font-weight: bold;">
                        scleractinian corals, 
                        foraminifera, bivalves, gastropods, cephalopods (excluding the 
                        nautiloids), star fish, echinoids, and bony fish
                    </span>
                    . Even though the 
                    faunas are named for periods and eras they occur through all 
                    the eras and periods, but their abundances change.

                    During the Cambrian Period the Cambrian fauna is dominate, during the remainder 
                    of the Paleozoic Era the Paleozoic Fauna is dominate. During the Mesozoic and 
                    Cenozoic the Modern Fauna makes up the largest part of the curve.
                    During the Paleozoic Era, after the initial Cambrian Explosion, there 
                    is a big increase in biodiversity during the Ordovician with the number of
                     marine families climbing to ~500. The level of biodiversity then stays mostly 
                     level until the end of the Paleozoic Era. There are two mass extinction events 
                     during the Paleozoic the End-Ordovician Extinction and the Late Devonian Extinction
                      events represented by red arrows. During these two Paleozoic extinction events the 
                      number of marine families drops quickly, but in each case they rebound quickly and 
                      return to the previous levels.

                        The second graph is similar to the first, but it focuses 
                        in on the Ordovician Period and shows part of the Cambrian 
                        and Silurian periods. 
                        
                        Instead of families it shows us the number 
                        of genera living. 
                        
                        During the Cambrian you can see the total number
                         of genera is around 500 and most of them are part of the Cambrian 
                         Fauna.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                         At the start of the Ordovician two things happen, the total 
                         number of genera increases sharply tripling to about 1500, while at 
                         the same time the dark blue curve representing the <span style="color: rgb(43, 43, 216); font-weight: bold;">Cambrian fauna 
                        decreases</span>, going from about 450 Cambrian Fauna genera to about 200 
                         genera. 
                         
                         This change is known as the Great Ordovician Biodiversification
                          Event (GOBE). The GOBE is the most significant increase of marine biodiversity 
                          of the Phanerozoic. 
                          
                          At the End-Ordovician a mass extinction event occurs
                           and 85% of all Ordovician species went extinct. 
                           
                           The red arrow and sharp 
                           drop of genera on the curve mark this event. This extinction is link to 
                           massive changes in the Ordovician climate and advance and retreat of large
                            glaciers. At the start of the Silurian the number of genera is around 700,
                             but it quickly climbs back up to over 1500, similar to levels during the 
                             Ordovician.
